I've spent the last decade flashing my home routers to DD-WRT but was never really satisfied because of the cheap (and poorly supported) hardware, unstable builds, and/or unfixed bugs. Not even talking of [the controversy](http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/columns/article.php/3816236/The-DD-WRT-Controversy.htm) about it.  

Since I needed to upgrade my Buffalo WHR-300HP2 AP/router to something able to get the most of my 200+Mbps cable connection, I recently decided to build my own.
