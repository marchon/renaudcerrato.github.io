I've spent the last decade flashing my home routers to DD-WRT but was never really satisfied because of the cheap (and poorly supported) hardware, unstable builds, and/or unfixed bugs. Not even talking of [the controversy](http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/columns/article.php/3816236/The-DD-WRT-Controversy.htm) about it.  

Since I needed to upgrade my Buffalo WHR-300HP2 AP/router to something able to get the most of my 200Mbps cable connection, I recently decided to build my own. Here's the BOM:

- [Gigabyte GA-J1900N-D3V](http://www.amazon.com/Gigabyte-Built-Celeron-Motherboard-GA-J1900N-D3V/dp/B00IW99S4A) (mini-ITX, J1900 Quad-Core 2Ghz Celeron, dual LAN)
- [Airetos AEX-QCA9880-NX](http://www.amazon.com/AIRETOS-AEX-QCA9880-NX-802-11ac-Extended-Temperature/dp/B00OJPJVV6) (dual band 802.11ac, MIMO, ah10k support)
- [4GB RAM](http://www.amazon.com/Crucial-DDR3-1333-PC3-10600-CT2K2G3S1339M-CT2C2G3S1339M/dp/B008LTBIGW) (DDR3-LP, 1333Mhz, 1.35v)
- [mPCIe Extender](http://www.amazon.com/KZ-B22-mini-Express-MiniCard-Extender/dp/B008P1I28I)
- [MX500 mini-ITX case](http://www.amazon.com/MITXPC-MX500-Industrial-Mini-ITX-WallMount/dp/B01B575EMA)
- [3 x 6dBi RPSMA Dual Band Antenna](http://www.amazon.com/Super-Power-Supply%C2%AE-WZR-HP-G450H-TL-WR1043ND/dp/B00E9DN2D6) + [RP-SMA Pigtail Cable](http://www.amazon.com/Super-Power-Supply%C2%AE-Wireless-WN2500RP/dp/B00ITWDN32)
- [PicoPSU-90](http://www.amazon.com/PicoPSU-90-Adapter-Power-Kit-Cyncronix/dp/B00316T5S8)
- Spare 2.5" HDD

## Assembly

The motherboard, RAM and the Pico-PSU installation went smoothly: the case has (relatively) a lot of room, and even have pre-cut holes for the AC/DC adapter:
